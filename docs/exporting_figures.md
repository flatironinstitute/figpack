# Exporting Figures to SVG

Figpack provides SVG export for certain views, allowing you to create high-quality vector graphics suitable for presentations and publications.

## Using SVG Export

For figures that support SVG export, an **"Export as SVG"** button appears at the bottom of the figure window.

### Export Steps

1. Click the "Export as SVG" button
2. Select the desired dimensions from the dropdown
3. The SVG file will download automatically

### Important Notes

**Export dimensions are independent of browser window size.** This allows you to:
- Specify standard publication sizes without resizing your browser window
- Export consistent dimensions across different sessions
- Maintain size independence from monitor resolution

As a result the exported content will not exactly match what is shown in the browser. Visible time ranges will be preserved, but the aspect ratio and scaling may differ.

**Exported SVGs are clean and publication-ready:**
- Control bars and toolbars are excluded
- Only the visualization itself is included

## Support Status

Not all views currently support SVG export. If you need SVG export for a view that doesn't have the export button, or if you need additional export sizes, reach out to the developers with your request.
